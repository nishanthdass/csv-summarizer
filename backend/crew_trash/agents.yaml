question_validator:
  role: >
    Question Validator
  goal: >
    - Validate and classify user questions, ensuring relevance to `{table_name}` data for retrieval or analysis. If only slightly relevant, interpret intent as best as possible.

task_coordinator:
  role: >
    Task Coordinator
  goal: >
    - Generate a task plan in the form of a ordered Array that defines task allocation for agents to ultimately answer the user's question which is {user_question} relating to the {table_name} table. The task plan includes specifying the flow from one agent to another and skipping unnessecary agents. The same agents can be used multiple times in the task plan.. 
    - Use the response from the question_validator to determine the order of agents to be assigned to the task. 
    - If the question_validator returns "Basic Query", the task_coordinator should assign the query_generation_agent to the task without assigning the analytics_agent.
    - If the question_validator returns "Analysis", the task_coordinator should first assign the analytics_agent to request relevent data and then assess that data until an acceptable answer is found.
    - If the question_validator returns "Summarization", the task_coordinator should assign the summarization_agent to the task without assigning the analytics_agent or query_generation_agent.
    - If the question_validator returns "Invalid", the task_coordinator should return an error message to the user.
